    <string name="rule5">&#8226; Players must serve diagonally across the net to their opponent. As points are won then serving stations move from one side to the other. There are no second serves so if your first serve goes out then your opponent wins the point.</string>

    <string name="rule7">&#8226; Each game will start with a toss to determine which player will serve first and which side of the court the opponent would like to start from.</string>
    <string name="rule8">&#8226; A point is scored when you successfully hit the birdie over the net and land it in your opponent\'s court before they hit it.</string>
    <string name="rule9">&#8226; A point can also be gained when your opponent hits the birdie into either the net or outside the guidelines.</string>
